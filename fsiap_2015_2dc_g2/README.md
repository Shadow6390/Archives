# Thermal Physics Simulator

The project consists in simulating thermal conditions of a server room, as to assess how server units should be placed in order to save costs with refrigeration.

## Motivation/BackStory

This project was developed for a curricular unit at ISEP (FÃ­sica Aplicada, Applied Physics, FSIAP). The project consisted in simulating thermal conditions of a server room, as to assess how server units should be placed in order to save costs with refrigeration. The project uses 3D (Java 3DWrapper) to view the simulated room and is developed in Java. The graphical library, used in the project, was developed aside by me, as to provide an easier way for the team to work with the UI (basically, all I did was write a wrapper for the 3D functions).


## Comments/Extra Notes

The project was developed for the 2nd year, 1st semester and got an evaluation of 18.54 out of 20. Was developed in a group of 4.

## Expected Changes

This project has no expected changes, and is considered "completed". The last time it was touched was around 2015 (if newer dates are found, it's because of file-copying).
