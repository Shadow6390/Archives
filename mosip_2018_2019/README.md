# Docking Station Traffic Simulation

This projects contains a simulator which allows for the simulation of the traffic impact of a docking site (specifically, Cais de Leixões).

## Motivation/BackStory

This project was developed for a curricular unit at ISEP's masters (Modelação e Simulação de Processos, Process Modelling and Simulation, MOSIP). The project consisted in using the contents learned in the curricular unit to develop simulator that would let its user obtain answers for a specific problem. In this case, Java was used for the development of a program to simulate docking traffic for a docking site. Cargo, Passanger and Oil ships can be simulated with various random distributions, as well as the different extraction equipments available for each type of ship, as to assess the impacts of different setups, in different enrivonments.


## Comments/Extra Notes

The project was developed for the 1st year, 2nd semester of my master's and got an evaluation of 18.6 out of 20. Was developed in a group of two.

## Expected Changes

This project has no expected changes, and is considered "completed". The last time it was touched was around 2018-2019 (if newer dates are found, it's because of file-copying).
