# CBuntu

This project consists of an unfinished C IDE for Ubuntu. The editor currently allows to create files, store them and generate a make file.

## Motivation/BackStory

For a given curricular unit at ISEP, Ubuntu was required as to develop programs in C (class demand, as most of the documentation was for Ubuntu). However, the IDEs available at the time were not reliable enough (and easy to use) as I had hoped. So I started developing this IDE just to have a decent IDE to do classes with.

Eventually, I ended up not needing the IDE in its complete, finalized state, as deliveries and exams started to get more frequent, but was a nice project to learn how to organize UI elements in an IDE fashion.


## Comments/Extra Notes

No further comments! :)

## Expected Changes

This project has no expected changes, but is considered "incomplete/unfinished". The last time it was touched was around 2015 (if newer dates are found, it's because of file-copying).
