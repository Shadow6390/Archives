<h2 id="imgConv">Image Convertion</h2>

<p>
This program can convert an image to an XPM image. The resulting XPM image
will have up to 64 different colors. The algorithm chooses the color that best
fits the current pixel being evaluated.
</p>
<p>
    <b>NOTE:</b> This program considers that the color with index 5 is the transparency color.
</p>
<br>
The format of the supported images are: JPEG and PNG.
<br>
<br>
How to use:
<ol>
    <li>Press the 'Add Image' button to add images to be converted. Multiple images can be added.</li> 
    <li>Check 'generate code-format' if you want the output to be in a format recognized in code (for copy-paste purposes).</li>
    <li>Press 'Output Path" to specifiy the folder where the generated files be placed.</li>
    <li>Click the 'Convert Images' button to convert all images in the list.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The convertion process uses multiple threads by default (the number of threads will be equal
    to half of the logical cores available). You can change the amount of threads used and whether to
    use multiple threads in the settings section. It is not recommended that you disable multiple thread
    usage, as it will slow the conversion process greatly.
</p>

<h2>Image Edition (Rotate, Scaling & Simple Edit)</h2>

<p>
    You can rotate and scale an image by going on the 'Transform' option on the menu bar and selecting
    the desired transformation.
</p>

<p>
    This software also allows simple edition of an XPM image. You can do so by pressing the 'Edit XPM' button.
    After choosing the desired XPM to edit, a window will open containing the image to edit and the 64
    colors you can use to paint it.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Image Preview</h2>
<p>
    You can view an XPM image by pressing the 'Preview XPM' button. After selecting the desired XPM file
    to preview, a window will open containing the XPM image.
