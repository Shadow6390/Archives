# XPM Converter

This project consists of an XPM editor. The editor allows the user to convert images into an XPM format, as well as do minor edits on them.

## Motivation/BackStory

This project was developed for a college curricular unit of one of my best friends. In the curricular unit, a game had to be developed using low-level language and XPM as graphics. Since my friend wasn't able to find a decent program that would convert any sprite he'd wanted into an XPM format, he dared me to do something. So I did :)

(if you happen to find a nasty name on the source code, please do ignore - it was to provoke my friend!)


## Comments/Extra Notes

The editor has a few "hiccups" when it comes to manually editing a sprite, that is, it could have better performance and user experience. However, apart from this, the program works as intended.

## Expected Changes

This project has no expected changes, and is considered "completed". The last time it was touched was around 2016 (if newer dates are found, it's because of file-copying).
